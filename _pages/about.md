Welcome to my website!

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca), University of Toronto. I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Linbo Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/linbowangpku/home) and Prof. [Ningyuan Chen](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/). Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from Wuhan University in 2024.
